# Smart Card Browser Extension

This smart card browser extension is an attempt to provide a bridge between the JavaScript world that a Web developer is familiar with, and the native smart card subsystems available in desktop platforms. It works in Windows 10 and 11, macOS and Linux.

The idea is that a Web developer who wants to have low level access to smart cards in the machine where the browser is running would add a `webcard.js` file to the page. That script would in turn check if the extension is installed and if not prompt the user to install it.

The extension adds a `webcard` object to `navigator` and through it `navigator.webcard.readers` provides a list of the smart card `reader` objects available in the machine. 
Each `reader` has a `name` and an `atr` if there is a card inserted on it.

`reader` has three methods:
- `connect` to establish a connection with the inserted card. It receives an optional argument to indicate if the connection should be exclusive or not (shared) the default is `true`
- `transcieve` that sends the APDU passed as a hexidecimal string and returs the response also as a hexadecimal string
- `disconnect` closes the connection

## Installing

Currently this development version requires manual installation of the unpacked extension:

1. Build the native client for your platfrom, running either `make` (macOS) or `MSBuild webcard.vcxproj` (Windows) in the `native` folder
2. Install the native client running `install.sh` (macOS) or `install.bat` (Windows) in the `native` folder
3. Open Chrome -> Extensions, enable developer mode and add the unpacked extension from the `extension` folder.
4. Open the test page, for example running `python3 -m http.server` from the `test` folder and then navigate to http://localhost:8000

## Native Messages

Messages to native:
```
{i: 'string', c: integer, r: integer, a: 'string', p: integer}
```
i: unique message identifier
c: command 1-list readers, 2-connect, 3-disconnect, 4-transcieve
r: index of reader in reader list
a: hex cAPDU to send to the card, sent only for c: 4
p: parameter, share mode for connect, sent only for c: 2

Messages from native:
```
{i: 'string', e: integer, r: integer, d: [array]|'string'}
```
i: unique message identifier, to link the response. Empty string on reader events
e: reader event 1-card insert, 2-card remove. Sent only for reader events
r: reader index for reader events
d: data 1-string array with list of readers, 2-card atr, 4-hex rAPDU

## Alternatives

There are apparently many options for [smart card extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/smart%20card?hl=en-US&_category=extensions) in the Chrome store. But I could not figure out how to use them for raw APDU exchange. Maybe one of those is more suitable for your project.
